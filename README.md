# FeatureNet
This is a re-implementation of FeatureNet in Tensorflow 2. FeatureNet is a deep learning architecture for machining feature recognition that utilises a voxel representation and 3D CNN.

The code is based on this original [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448518301349). This aapers original code can be found [here](https://github.com/zibozzb/FeatureNet).

## Requirements
